# Obsidian Nostr Articles

> Publish and manage nostr articles from Obsidian

A rewrite of [nostr-writer](https://github.com/jamesmagoo/nostr-writer) plugin focused on nostr articles and using [applesauce](https://github.com/hzrd149/applesauce) and [blossom](https://github.com/hzrd149/blossom-client-sdk).

## Install / Update

### In Obsidian

WIP

### Manually Installing the Plugin

- Head over to [releases](https://github.com/hzrd149/obsidian-nostr-publisher/releases) and download a release - latest is recommended - (or the pre-release for upcoming features.)
- Navigate to your plugin folder in your preferred vault: `VaultFolder/.obsidian/plugins/`
- Create a new folder called `nostr-publisher`
- Copy and paste over `main.js`, `styles.css`, `manifest.json` into the newly created `/nostr-publisher` folder.
- Make sure you enable the plugin by going into Settings > Community plugins > Installed plugins > toggle 'Nostr Publisher'.
